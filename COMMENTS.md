Please analyze this codebase and create an AGENTS.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.
If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.

If there's already an AGENTS.md, improve it if it's located in /Users/mjo/Projects/app/sj

I'll analyze the codebase to create an AGENTS.md file with build commands and code style guidelines. Let me first examine the existing structure and any configuration files.

Now I'll create the AGENTS.md file based on my analysis of this Rails codebase:

Created AGENTS.md with essential build commands and code style guidelines based on the Rails gaming application codebase analysis. The file includes RSpec testing patterns, HAML view conventions, CanCanCan authorization, and the specific naming/validation patterns used throughout the application.

Have you any comments on or criticisms of this project?

Looking at this Rails gaming application, I have several observations:

**Positive aspects:**
- Clean MVC architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Good use of Rails conventions (ActiveRecord, strong parameters, concerns)
- Internationalization support with locale files
- Authorization with CanCanCan and authentication with bcrypt
- Comprehensive test coverage using RSpec with feature and model tests
- Modern Rails features (Turbo, Stimulus, importmap)
- Custom helper methods for Bootstrap grid utilities

**Areas for improvement:**
- **Security**: Direct regex validation in models could be more robust. Consider using validated gems for email/phone formats
- **Performance**: Default scope on User model (`order(:handle)`) may impact performance on large datasets
- **Code organization**: Some complex helper methods (like `col`) could be refactored into smaller, more focused methods
- **Database**: Missing indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `admin` boolean, foreign keys)
- **Error handling**: Controllers lack comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- **Dependencies**: Some gems are pinned to older versions that may have security vulnerabilities
- **Frontend**: Heavy reliance on server-rendered views; could benefit from more interactive JavaScript components
- **Testing**: Missing unit tests for models (only found feature tests)
- **Deployment**: Basic Capistrano setup but lacks CI/CD pipeline configuration

The codebase follows Rails best practices well but could benefit from performance optimization and more robust error handling as it scales.
